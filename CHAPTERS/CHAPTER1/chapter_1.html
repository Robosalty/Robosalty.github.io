                                    It wasn't a long distance between Emily's school and Merilyn's shack. Biking uphill through the dirt road, though, took some serious getting-used-to 
                                    for non-Eshore folks. Erik eventually reached the outskirts and parked his bike in front of an unimpressive house. Next to it was a grassy field of 
                                    roaming goats and chickens gated behind a wooden fence.<br><br>

                                    Some may ask why a farm would need to be next to a postal office. This is one of the many mysteries of Eshore: Up on the hill stands a wooden shack whose 
                                    owner's business is unknown. One day, it's a fruit stand...another it's an egg and dairy farm. Now, it's a post office with livestock. Where she gets the licenses to do any of this is unknown.
                                    Some speculate the owner is in hiding, hence the constant changes. This rumor never seemed to change business though.<br><br>

                                    Erik is hardly an official employee but, he does get paid a decent amount. If the rumors are true, he should probably stay away from the police.<br><br>

                                    All the years of watching Thomas and Bubba's Supernatural Extravaganza could not prepare Erik for the scene before him.
                                     A boy, maybe around his age, learned how to fly. He stood there like a deer in the headlights as the boy flew above before crashing 
                                     into the opposing wooden fence, cradling a baby goat in his arms.<br><br>

                                    The boy groans a bit but, eventually, gets back on his feet. The goat looks disinterested if anything.<br><br>

                                    Julian extends his hand to Erik and gives him a kind smile. Erik found irony in how the boy carried a sort of aura he can only describe
                                    as bright, charming yet chaotically misfortuned. At least, that seemed to be the case with animals. He hesitantly reciprocates Julian's
                                    welcoming gesture, wondering if bad luck could be contagious.<br><br>

                                    However, before their hands could make contact, Erik suddenly hears something: this strumming noise...similar to the plucking of a harp. 
                                    Erik looks around for this strange musician but, finds no one besides them three. Merilyn seemed unbothered, still rummaging through some paper
                                    work. <br><br>

                                    Maybe he was hearing things. That's what he thought until he saw Julian's reaction.<br><br>

                                Julian clearly wasn't someone who could hide his face (though he definitely tried to) and, while Erik's face reading skills were certainly not the greatest, he did feel some satisfaction in noticing a falter in the boy's smile. For a second, Julian looked uncomfortable and a bit
                                concerned. Their hands were already joined together by this point but, his eyes looked away from Eriks' and the corners of his mouth formed a slight frown. 
                                Erik's face searching was interrupted almost immediately, however, as Merilyn came back out with a clipboard. <br><br>

                                Even so, Erik came to an obvious conclusion: Julian had <i> definitely </i>  heard whatever that harp noise was. <br><br>
