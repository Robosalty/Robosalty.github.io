                        <p> Emily quickly loses interest in the topic and adamantly proceeds to pester Erik on the couch.

                            The frail woman has already nodded off to sleep, mouth slightly agape. He remembers telling her she didn’t have 
                            to stay up with them during their movie nights (knowing someone was very keen to watch hours at a time) but she had
                            insisted regardless. <br><br>

                            “Dinggg”. A muffled sound broke through Emily's strange animal groaning noises.<br><br>

                            residence is a heavy sleeper; A few "cling clangs" here and there surely wouldn't disrupt the peace. After a long night, he tosses himself in to 
                            bed as well and takes another glance at his phone. Erik responds with a simple "Ok." before drifting off to sleep. <br><br>

                            He dreams of a lone figure whose face he couldn't make out in the gloom of Eshore's fog, his mysterious new co-worker. Oddly enough, he wasn't scared of this
                            unknown presence. A dead flashlight dangled at his side. Before Erik can walk any closer, his dream had turned up blank until sunrise.<br><br>

                            Emily walks away giddy, a little pep in her step as she passes through the front gate. Truthfully, she really did find the episode last night spooky and crawled
                            into Nana's bed after she was absolutely sure Erik had fallen asleep. Even so, she still wanted to watch it again! If her big brother used to like the show, why
                            not now?<br><br>

                            'Things change?...then they'll just have to change episodes!'
