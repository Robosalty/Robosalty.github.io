            <h2>Latest Chapter</h2>
            <p> Pyruss looks a little solemn after speaking his tale. However, it was hard to tell where the stone-hearted prince, now feathered highness, and mournful brother began. Erik contemplates his words for a minute. <br><br>

                “So…What you’re saying is the deer man who kidnapped you, the one we saw earlier… he’s your brother?” <br><br>
                
                Pyruss looks toward the ground and shakes his head. 
                
                “No.” he starts. “Whoever this person is, they are <i>not</i> my brother.”<br><br>
                
                “How can you be certain?”. Julian meets eyes with Erik before continuing “I don’t suppose there are many deer people roaming around Eshore.”
